# Manifest

The final manifest.json is generated by merging common.json with either chrome.json (for Chrome) or firefox.json (for Firefox).

Both Chrome and Firefox specify the browser-specific key that determines the extension ID. This helps debugging and interoperability with other extensions.

As a performance optimization, Chrome loads content_script_loader.js into every frame of every page, instead of the full client. Firefox is too buggy for this optimization.
